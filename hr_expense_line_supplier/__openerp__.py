Supplier on expense line
========================
This module adds a supplier field on the expense line.

A second module will automatically install after this one, setting the field
as 'required'. We need to separate this in 2 modules because we need the demo
expense lines to have a supplier before setting the field required. This is
done in order to avoid warnings on installation with demo data activated.
